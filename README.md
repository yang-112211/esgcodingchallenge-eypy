1.Overview
- What is the issue?
The global population is estimated to grow to around 8.5 billion by the year 2030 - that is according to recent projections. We currently consume far beyond what the planet can provide. The growing population and the use of unsustainable uses of the planet's natural resources is causing major impacts, such as rising pollution levels, the destruction of ecosystems and climate change.

- How technology can help
We can use technology to better inform ourselves with what products are sustainable and eco friendly for the planet. This may be providing information about what companies are doing to become more sustainable or what sustainable ingredients a product contains - especially now with the popularity of mobile devices, people are able to gather information on the go and when they want. By using technology to provide this information, it may influence consumer on what products to buy if they are to live a more eco friendly, sustainable lifestyle.

3. The idea
There are more and more everyday products being sustainably produced by companies for consumers who want to live a more sustainable lifestyle. Sometimes it is hard to keep up with what is available in the market. This is where the Living Green app can provide information about sustainable products on the market.
Using this mobile app, consumers can see what ingredients are contained in a product. They are also able to post products that are not currently on the app. This will haelp other consumers to know what is available to them. This also enables the app to be kept up to date with new products.
Consumers are also able to leave reviews/recommendations on products that they have had experience with. This allows for honest community input on the app thus potentially influencing someone to make a decision on purchasing the sustainable product.
